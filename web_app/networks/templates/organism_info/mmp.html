The archaeon Halobacterium NRC-1 is an extreme halophile that thrives in saturated brine environments such as the Dead Sea and solar salterns. It offers a versatile and easily assayed system for an array of well-coordinated physiologies that are necessary for survival in its harsh environment [1]. It has robust DNA repair systems that can efficiently reverse the damages caused by a variety of mutagens including UV radiation and desiccation/re-hydration cycles [2,3]. Halobacterium NRC-1 adapts its metabolism to anaerobic conditions with the synthesis of bacterorhodopsin, which facilitates the conversion of energy from light into ATP. The completely sequenced genome of Halobacterium NRC-1 (containing ~2,600 genes) has provided insights into many of its physiological capabilities, however nearly half of all genes encoded in the halobacterial genome have no known function [4-7].
