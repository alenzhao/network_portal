  <h2>About the Network Portal</h2>
  <p>version: {{version}}</p>
  <p>The Network Portal is a database of gene transcription regulatory networks, 
    enabling exploration, annotation and comparative analysis. Deciphering the complexity of biological systems requires system level view of the regulatory players and their interactions. However, complexity of these interactions and uncertainity in their inference present a challenge for analysis and biological discovery. Furthermore, visualizing and analyzing these interactions often requires advanced computational expertise, tools and resources. Network Portal provides analysis and visualization tools for selected gene regulatory networks to aid researchers in biological discovery and hypothesis development.</p>
  <h5>Method</h5>
  <p> Network Portal integrates identification ofconditionally co-regulated group of genes by using <a href="http://baliga.systemsbiology.net/cmonkey">cMonkey</a> and inference of regulatory influences by using <a href="http://baliga.systemsbiology.net/drupal/content/inferelator">Inferelator</a>. In addition, it is integrated with<a href="http://microbesonline.org">MicrobesOnline</a> for genomic information and <a href="http://regprecise.lbl.gov/RegPrecise">RegPrecise</a> for collection of manually curatedregulatory inferences.
