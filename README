Network portal
==============

A Rails 3 web-app for archiving and exploring gene-regulatory networks as
produced by the cMonkey and Inferelator algorithms.

(see: baliga.systemsbiology.net/cmonkey)

This is a prototype, likely to be abandoned.

It's only capabilities are to show test networks in cytoscape web with or
without nice jQuery UI.
