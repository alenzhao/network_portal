Network_portal TODO
===================

Home page
---------
  About in center, link to more detail on biological purpose
   * what are GRN's and what do we hope to learn from them?
   * brief explanation of cMonkey and Inferelator and links
   * links to papers: cMonkey, Inferelator, EGRIN, etc.
   * links to data sources and partner sites: microbes online, RegPrecise/RegPredict, kegg, etc.
  Clean up statistics box
  Make news into RSS / Atom / or Twitter feed


Search
------
  Return genes, functions, biclusters, species
  Accepts as input: genes, functions, species, plus related terms from descriptions and synonyms
   * examples:
      VNG0536*
      sirR (any capitalization)
      1447364 (gene ID)
      "transcription repressor"
      hal
      halo
      halobacterium
      dvu
      dvh
      GO:0060286
      flagellar cell motility
      Alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism
  limit search to a specific organism or network


Gene tabs
---------
  what does this do when there is more than one network for a species?
  gene tab, circle thing?
  gene tab: either put stuff in tabs or all in one page, not both
  gene tab: gene neighborhood graphic?
  gene | regulators: implement
  gene | motifs: implement
  gene | functions: implement
  links to regulators and conditions


Bicluster tabs
--------------
  bicluster / regulon tab
   * either put stuff in tabs or all in one page, not both
  bicluster | conditions tab?
  bicluster | functions
   * show number of genes
   * show type of function (KEGG/GO/etc.)
   * let the user filter to a specific type of function
  bicluster | genes: link to gene


Cleanup
-------
  Remove Contact / Login until implemented?
  duplicate IDs in HTML elements
  ReSTful URLs
  move bicluster-tabs page and gene-tabs page into separate apps?
  identify biclusters by (network_id and k) or id consistently


Features to be added later
--------------------------
  Login through ISB gmail accts
  links into microbes online
  links into RegPrecise, RegPredict
  cMonkey/inferelator stats for a given network
  view network for a set of genes
  programmatic API
  gaggle microformats


Use-cases (biological questions)
--------------------------------
  given a set of genes, what regulates them?
  given a set of genes, what functions do they have?
  given a regulator, what genes does it regulate?
  given a regulator, what functions does it regulate?
  find all possible motifs for a regulator?
  promoter architectures?
  given a KEGG pathway or function, find genes/biclusters
