Network_portal TODO
===================

Home page
---------
  About in center, link to more detail on biological purpose
  Clean up statistics box
  Make news into RSS / Atom / or Twitter feed


Search
------
  Return genes, functions, biclusters, species


Gene tabs
---------
  gene tab, circle thing?
   * either put stuff in tabs or all in one page, not both
   * gene neighborhood graphic?
  gene | regulators: implement
  gene | motifs: implement
  gene | functions: implement
  gene | regulon neighbourhood: this should be a set of genes
  links to regulators and conditions


Bicluster tabs
--------------
  bicluster / regulon tab
   * either put stuff in tabs or all in one page, not both
  bicluster | conditions tab?
  bicluster | functions
   * show number of genes
   * show type of function (KEGG/GO/etc.)
   * let the user filter to a specific type of function
  bicluster | genes: link to gene


Cleanup
-------
  Remove Contact / Login until implemented


Features to be added later
--------------------------
  Login through ISB gmail accts
  links into microbes online
  links into RegPrecise, RegPredict
  cMonkey/inferelator stats for a given network
  view network for a set of genes


Use-cases (biological questions)
--------------------------------
  given a set of genes, what regulates them?
  given a set of genes, what functions do they have?
  given a regulator, what genes does it regulate?
  given a regulator, what functions does it regulate?
  find all possible motifs for a regulator?
  promoter architectures?
  given a KEGG pathway or function, find genes/biclusters
