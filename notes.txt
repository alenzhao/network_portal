Network portal project notes
============================

This is a log file of the steps used to create the Network Portal app. It's a
rails 3.0.x app, using MySQL and jQuery.


== create rails app

rails new network_portal -d mysql
cd network_portal/
mv README rails.README
touch README
add gem "mongrel" to Gemfile
bundle

rails server

browser to: http://127.0.0.1:3000/


== added routes to use erb templates for static pages

root :to => "static#index"
match 'about' => "static#about"

see: app/controllers/static_controller.rb
     app/views/static/*

== create DB and configure rails

start mysql
log-in as root
create database network_portal_development;
create user 'network_portal'@'localhost' identified by 'some password';
grant all privileges on network_portal_development.* to 'network_portal'@'localhost';

Got warning message:
WARNING: This version of mysql2 (0.3.6) doesn't ship with the ActiveRecord adapter bundled anymore as it's now part of Rails 3.1
WARNING: Please use the 0.2.x releases if you plan on using it in Rails <= 3.0.x

Edit Gemfile to:
gem 'mysql2', '< 0.3'
bundle

ok

== convert project to use jQuery instead of prototype

rake rails:template LOCATION=https://github.com/lleger/Rails-3-jQuery/raw/master/jquery.rb
